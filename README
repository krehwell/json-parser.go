Go JSON Lexer

A simple, lightweight JSON tokenizer (lexer) written in Go

🚀 features
    - hand-written lexer: no external generator tools.  built using standard go libraries.
    - identifies:
         - objects ({, }) and arrays ([, ])
         - strings (including support for escaped characters)
         - numbers (integers, decimals, and scientific notation)
         - booleans (true, false) and null
    - validation: basic validation for bad numbers and unterminated strings.
    - pretty print: includes a helper function to display tokens in a structured table.

the program takes a raw JSON string and breaks it down into a slice of token structs.  each token contains a type and its literal value.

that's it.  not much :)

never use this for production!!! test
